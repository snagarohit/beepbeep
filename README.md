# Beautiful Timer: Time, Made Beautiful

Beautiful Timer is not merely an application — it is an experience. Conceived in a sun-lit studio in Cupertino and crafted with the same obsessive attention to detail you would expect of a precision-milled watch, Beautiful Timer transforms the simple act of measuring time into a moment of quiet celebration.

It began as a personal exploration: could a timer feel less like software and more like a beautifully weighted object? Could the gentle sweep of a second hand calm an anxious mind, helping neurodivergent thinkers slip effortlessly into focus? The result is an ad-free, delightfully tactile instrument that you will want to reach for again and again.

## A Symphony of Considered Details

1. **The Continuous Sweep**  
   Traditional timers tick; Beautiful Timer glides. Rendered at the refresh rate of your display, the conic gradient moves with a buttery smoothness reminiscent of the seconds hand on a Rolex Oyster Perpetual. Time becomes something you feel, not just read.

2. **Multi-Tab Harmony**  
   Whether you are orchestrating deep work across myriad browser windows or simply checking email, Beautiful Timer remains in perfect sync by harnessing the browser's `storage` events. Change the duration in one tab and every other tab breathes in unison.

3. **The Chorded Chime**  
   Alerts should prompt, never jolt. Four pure sine waves — 4096 Hz, 8192 Hz, 12 288 Hz and 16 384 Hz — rise and fade in a concise duet, gently nudging you back to attention. Need something more verbal? Let the built-in speech synthesis fondly announce the time.

4. **Tactile Control**  
   Drag the dial, feel the resistance, set intention. `Math.atan2` translates your movement into minutes and seconds, allowing a form of direct manipulation that makes conventional drop-downs feel archaic.

5. **Orientation Intelligence**  
   On mobile, Beautiful Timer pirouettes gracefully. Icons rotate, geometry recalibrates, and the interface remains impeccably legible — portrait or landscape.

6. **Typography & Colour**  
   We humanise pixels with Geist Sans and Geist Mono, paired with the warm neutrality of the `stone` palette in perceptually uniform OKLCH. The result is a canvas that disappears, letting your work shine.

## The Bottom Line

BeepBeep exists because I needed it to exist. If it helps you too, that's beautiful. If you know someone who might need a timer that actually gets it, send them here.

We're all just trying to focus in a world that makes it really, really hard. Let's help each other out.

*Built with love, caffeine, and the stubborn belief that tools should work for humans, not the other way around.*

**No ads. No tracking. No bullshit. Just a timer that works.**
