/* PHILOSOPHY */
Beautiful Timer is crafted with the philosophy that the best tools
disappear into the background, enabling rather than demanding attention.
It's a gift to the neurospicy community - 100% free, ad-free, and
built with obsessive attention to detail.

No tracking. No ads. No subscriptions. Just pure focus.

"Time is not a river flowing in one direction—it's an ocean, 
and some of us are drowning. Beautiful Timer is a lighthouse."
